To add a new reference:

1. Add it to the bib-file

2. Run the following command in the references directory:

pandoc -f markdown -t markdown_mmd+yaml_metadata_block-raw_html --bibliography=fintel-works.bib --csl=unified-kvf-works.csl --wrap=none --citeproc work-template.md -o work.md -s

3. Currently, I need to handcode the strikethrough for since ~~since~~ once work.md has been updated.

3. Copy the resulting work.md file to the content directory, overwriting the previous versions

4. Push the commit to github; netlify will detect and deploy the new version
