## Venue

- Class taught at [The 3nd Crete Summer School of Linguistics](https://www.phl.uoc.gr/cssl19/index.php)
- University of Crete, Gallos, Rethymnon, Greece
- July 13-26, 2019

## Instructor

- Kai von Fintel

## Course description

This intermediate to advanced class will review what is known about exclusive markers like *only* and its cousins (in English and cross-linguistically). Topics include dimensions of meaning, mirativity, NPI licensing, the relation to exhaustification, the role of exclusives in expressions of sufficiency, the interaction with bare plurals and bare conditionals. 

## Pre-class survey

If you're going to take the *only* class, please fill out [a short survey](https://forms.gle/AbLmsNEiwCQNxKBo7), to help me plan the class.

## Prerequisites

Just kidding, there are no prerequisites other than being interested in the class. However, since the audience will be quite diverse, I encourage you to read [an article of mine on "prerequisites"](http://www.kaivonfintel.org/prerequisites/).

## Early readings

These readings should get you started thinking about these topics. Do not expect to necessarily fully understand everything. I'll try to help you get into the material when I teach the class.
