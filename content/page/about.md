This is the website of Kai von Fintel. I'm a professor of [linguistics](http://mit.edu/linguistics) at [MIT](http://mit.edu/). I work on meaning. I have a wife, two kids, two cats, and a dog. I live in an intentional community ([Mosaic Commons Cohousing](http://mosaic-commons.org/)) in Berlin, Massachusetts. I am a runner. I like soccer, a lot. I was born on a cold winter's night in a small village on the LÃ¼neburg Heath in Northern Germany. My pronouns are he/him/his.

This isn't the only place I'm present on the net:
