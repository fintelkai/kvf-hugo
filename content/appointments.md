You can self-schedule appointments with me that are either half an hour long or a full hour. Meetings are often more productive if I get a look at relevant material (such as a draft handout) in advance. Please only schedule a full hour if you will in fact send me pre-meeting material at least a week in advance.

**Note that I will be on vacation December 19 through January 3. Between January 4 and February 15, I will only be available for meetings on Fridays. Once the spring semester begins on February 16, I will also be available at other times.**
