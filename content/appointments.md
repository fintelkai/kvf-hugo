title: "Appointments with Kai"

You can self-schedule appointments with me that are either half an hour long or a full hour. Meetings are often more productive if I get an advanced look at relevant material (such as a draft handout). Please only schedule a full hour if you will in fact send me pre-meeting material at least a week in advance.

Here are the links to schedule appointments:
