title: "Appointments with Kai"

I will post my availability for meetings in the Fall of 2021 in due time.

<!-- You can self-schedule appointments with me that are either half an hour long or a full hour. Meetings are often more productive if I get an advanced look at relevant material (such as a draft handout). Please only schedule a full hour if you will in fact send me pre-meeting material at least a week in advance. -->
