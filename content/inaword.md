In the summer of 2022 (and again briefly in 2023), I was given the opportunity to write a series of 500-word columns for the "In a word" feature in the *Monitor Weekly*, filling in while my friend Melissa Mohr was taking a sabbatical to work on her next book. (If you don't know her book on swearing, "Holy Sh\*t: A Brief History of Swearing", you should definitely [check it out](https://bookshop.org/p/books/holy-sh-t-a-brief-history-of-swearing-melissa-mohr/7854674?ean=9780190491680).)

There are eight columns. I give here links to those that are (as of now) available on the web (note that a paywall kicks in after you've accessed three articles, so choose wisely) but also to PDF offprints. Note that as usual in the business, I had no input or say about the titles that were given to my pieces.
