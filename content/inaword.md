In the summer of 2022, I was given the opportunity to write a series of 500-word columns for the "In a word" feature in the *Monitor Weekly*, filling in while my friend Melissa Mohr was taking a sabbatical to work on her next book. (If you don't know her book on swearing, "Holy Sh\*t: A Brief History of Swearing", you should definitely [check it out](https://bookshop.org/p/books/holy-sh-t-a-brief-history-of-swearing-melissa-mohr/7854674?ean=9780190491680).)

There are seven columns. I give here links to the six that are (as of now) available on the web and also to PDF offprints. Note that as usual in the business, I had no input or say about the titles that were given to my pieces.

1. ["‘If’ brings us into the realm of possibilities"](https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/In-a-Word/2022/0808/If-brings-us-into-the-realm-of-possibilities) ([pdf](/pdf/fintel-2022-CSM-Column-1-If.pdf))
2. ["Need just the right word? German probably has it."](https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/In-a-Word/2022/0829/Need-just-the-right-word-Why-German-probably-has-it) ([pdf](/pdf/fintel-2022-CSM-Column-2-German.pdf))
3. ["Human experience is shared, even if words aren’t"](https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/In-a-Word/2022/1003/Human-experience-is-shared-even-if-words-aren-t) ([pdf](/pdf/fintel-2022-CSM-Column-3-TFW.pdf))
4. ["Meet the ‘noble cousins’ on the family tree of words"](https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/In-a-Word/2022/1003/Meet-the-noble-cousins-on-the-family-tree-of-words) ([pdf](/pdf/fintel-2022-CSM-Column-4-NobleCousins.pdf))
5. ["The words that evoke ‘sound pictures’"](https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/In-a-Word/2022/1010/The-words-that-evoke-sound-pictures) ([pdf](/pdf/fintel-2022-CSM-Column-5-Lautbilder.pdf))
6. ["Words help construct the reality we live in"](https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/In-a-Word/2022/1017/Words-help-construct-the-reality-we-live-in) ([pdf](/pdf/fintel-2022-CSM-Column-6-Chomsky.pdf))
7. "Other attempts to convey irony in writing" ([pdf](/pdf/fintel-2022-CSM-Column-7-Irony.pdf))

When I find the time, I plan to provide some commentary and links to relevant sources and follow-up reading.
