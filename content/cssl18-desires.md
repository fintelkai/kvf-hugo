## Course description

In this intermediate/advanced class, we will discuss classic and current work on the semantics and, to a lesser extent, syntax of desire constructions. We will mostly focus on wanting, wishing, hoping, intending. There are plenty of parallels and connections, for example to deontic modality, teleological modality, imperatives, optatives. Among other things, the class will help students become comfortable with work in intensional semantics. 

## Pre-class survey

If you're going to take the desire class, please fill out [a short survey](https://goo.gl/forms/YILxL4uDe2ByEc762), to help us plan the class.

## Prerequisites

Just kidding, there are no prerequisites other than being interested in the class. However, since the audience will be quite diverse, we encourage you to read [an article by Kai on "prerequisites"](http://www.kaivonfintel.org/prerequisites/).

## Q&A

If you have any questions about the material covered in this class, please ask them [in a shared Google doc](https://goo.gl/2HESTX). We will try to answer questions in the document or via other channels.

## Eight topics

1. Introduction to possible worlds semantics, including basic Hintikka semantics for attitudes. Overview of issues about expressions of desire and preference.
2. The main semantic questions about desires. Belief-relativity, monotonicity, conflicting desires, gradability.
3. The syntax of desire.
4. Complement/mood selection.
5. Anankastic conditionals.
6. Conditional desires.
7. X-marking.
8. X-marked desires.
