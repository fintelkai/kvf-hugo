The MIT Libraries just made available [a new website displaying various statistics about our Open Access DSpace repository](https://oastats.mit.edu/index.php). I have three papers in that archive. Here are the download counts for those papers:

And here is a graph with the cumulative download count over time:

I can't compare this to the download numbers that these articles get at the official publisher sites because publishers don't seem to share those numbers with their authors. But it makes clear that DSpace is a legitimate distribution venue and that I should probably make as much of my work available through it as is feasible. Stay tuned.
