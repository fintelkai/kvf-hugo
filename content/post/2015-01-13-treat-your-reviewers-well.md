title: Treat your reviewers well

[S&P](http://semprag.org) asks its reviewers to overcome the discipline's culture of procrastination and supply reviews within a default of 4 weeks (sometimes more for especially complex or long papers). We try to repay reviewers in two ways that we consider best practices:

* Reviewers are copied on editorial decisions. They are sent the editor's feedback to the author and copies of all the reviews.
* Reviewers are notified when a paper they worked on for us is published.

Neither practice is as widespread as it should be. In fact, sometimes when we have a new editorial team member, they are skeptical about sharing the entire editorial feedback with the reviewers. It doesn't take long for them to change their minds when we get the usual enthusiastic feedback from reviewers.

This morning we published [a new paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.3765/sp.8.3) and I spent a few minutes notifying the five reviewers that had worked on various iterations of the article. I just got this response: "Thanks for letting me know. It's nice of you to do this for reviewers. I wish other journals would follow you too ..."
