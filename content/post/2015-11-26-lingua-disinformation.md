Linguists today received a misleading email from Elsevier sent to everyone who has ever submitted to or reviewed for *Lingua*, the journal whose editorial board has decided to not work with Elsevier anymore and restart the journal as the open-access journal *Glossa*. Here is Elsevier's email:

> Dear *Lingua* Authors and Reviewers
>
> As I am sure you are aware, as of the end of December 2015 the current *Lingua* Senior Editorial team will be standing down from their roles on the journal. Together this team and the Publisher would like to reassure you that while still in post they will continue their work for *Lingua* as they have always done during their tenure.
>
> Further information regarding the handling of papers from January 2016 onwards will be sent in due course, but should you have any queries or concerns in the meantime please do not hesitate to contact us via the 'Contact' button on the journal homepage or via the following email address: lingua@elsevier.com .
>
> My colleagues and I would also like to take this opportunity to reaffirm that we remain totally committed to the publication of *Lingua* as a quality journal serving the field of linguistics and look forward to supporting the journal and the linguistics community for many years to come.
>
> Best Regards
>
> Ann Corney, Publishing Director, Applied Social Sciences, Elsevier Ltd

There has been a lot of puzzlement over this message. Some comments below, but first a message from the interim editors of the successor journal *Glossa*, which I have been asked to help disseminate:

> Dear colleagues,
>
> Those among you who have been authors and/or reviewers for *Lingua* were sent a message today by Elsevier, and you might wonder about the journal, *Glossa*, to be set up by the very same editorial team which has contributed to the high reputation of *Lingua* in the past.
>
> As of the end of December 2015, the current executive and associated editors of *Lingua* will stand down. The next day, they will be in charge of *Glossa*. Until that date, the undersigned will be in charge as interim editors of *Glossa*, (backed up by the entire former editorial board of *Lingua* which already resigned in October).
>
> In that capacity, we would like to reassure you that *Glossa* will pick up where *Lingua* left off. We would also like to draw your attention to the fact that any author has the right to withdraw their submission from any journal as long as the copyright forms have not been signed.
>
> We are currently working on the website (including an online submission system etc.) for *Glossa*, and will come back to you as soon as it is operational. In the meantime, you can send your questions to both of us.
>
> All best wishes,
> Waltraud Paul and Guido Vanden Wyngaerd, interim editors of *Glossa*
> <wpaul@ehess.fr> & <guido.vandenwyngaerd@arts.kuleuven.be>

Some comments:

1. I would like to reiterate that despite the desperate rhetoric in the last sentence of Ms. Corney's email, there is no way at all that whatever zombie journal Elsevier manages to keep running under the venerable name *Lingua* will have any moral right to be seen as the continuation of *Lingua*. Instead, *Glossa* is the rightful continuation.
2. I also reiterate my call to the community not to work with Elsevier in propping up *Zombie Lingua*. Instead, get ready to support *Glossa* once it's fully running in January.
3. Lastly, authors with manuscripts currently under submission to *Lingua* should consider their options; please contact the interim editors of *Glossa* with any questions about that.
