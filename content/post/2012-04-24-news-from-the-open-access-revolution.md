Three items of interest on the open access front:

* Harvard council [advises faculty to publish through open access venues](http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k77982&tabgroupid=icb.tabgroup143448). Coverage of this memo: [Chronicle of Higher Education](http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/saying-costly-subscriptions-cannot-be-sustained-harvard-library-committee-urges-open-access/42589?sid=wc&utm_source=wc&utm_medium=en), [Inside Higher Ed](http://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2012/04/24/panel-questions-harvard-librarys-journal-spending), [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/print/2012/04/harvard-now-spending-nearly-375-million-on-academic-journals/256248/), [The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/apr/24/harvard-university-journal-publishers-prices)
* MIT open access working group [devising MIT's response to Elsevier's hostility towards open access preprint mandates](http://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/244/holton.html)
* The Elsevier boycott [has now over 10,000 signatures](http://thecostofknowledge.com/).

I think it is becoming clearer all the time that academic publishing will turn inexorably and perhaps quite quickly towards full open access. The question is which publishers and which universities, scholarly societies, and funding agencies will be at the forefront and who will lag behind.

[I will only occasionally posts news items of this nature. If you want to follow the revolution more closely, I recommend [Peter Suber's Google+ updates](https://plus.google.com/109377556796183035206/posts) and [Stuart Shieber's blog](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/pamphlet/).]
