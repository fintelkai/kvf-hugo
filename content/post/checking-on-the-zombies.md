Prompted by [an exchange with Brooke Larson on twitter](https://twitter.com/BrookeTLarson/status/765540452208553984), I decided it was time to check on the health of everyone's favorite zombie, the journal *Lingua*, whose editorial team defected en masse to start the open access journal *Glossa*. Since January this year, Zombie Lingua has been edited by "Interim Editor-in-chief" Harry Whitaker. Since January 1, the journal has published an impressive number of peer-reviewed articles: 49 in total (there are some others, like introductions to special issues, that have no peer review information). I inspected the date information on those articles. Here's the upshot:

- all of the articles were first submitted before January 2016. So, there have not been any articles published that were submitted to Zombie Lingua in its new incarnation.
- 36 articles (73%) were accepted by the old team and just published in 2016.
- 13 articles (27%) were accepted by the new team after a revised version (using the feedback from the old team) was submitted.
- 10 of the 13 articles (77%) accepted by the new team were accepted on the very day they were received, so with little or no editorial oversight. In fact, on one day (March 31), seven articles were submitted and accepted on the spot. A banner day.

I think it's safe to say that we have no evidence that Zombie Lingua is alive.
