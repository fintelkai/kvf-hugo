Abstract:
<blockquote>A cherished semantic universal is that determiners are conservative (<a class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr" data-open="C2">Barwise &amp; Cooper 1981</a>; <a class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr" data-open="C12">Keenan &amp; Stavi 1986</a>). Well-known problem cases are <em>only</em> (if it has determiner uses) and certain uses of proportional determiners like <em>many</em> (<a class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr" data-open="C20">Westerståhl 1985</a>). <a class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr" data-open="C7">Fortuny (2017)</a>, in a retracted contribution to this journal, proposed a new constraint (the Witness Set Constraint) to replace Conservativity. He claimed that his constraint is satisfied by only and the Westerståhl-<em>many</em>, thus correctly allowing the existence of these non-conservative determiners, whilst it is not satisfied by unattested non-conservative determiners (such as <em>allnon</em>). In fact, we show here that <em>only</em> does not satisfy Fortuny’s Witness Set Constraint (nor does Westerståhl-<em>many</em>, which we leave to the readers to convince themselves of). Upon reflection, it turns out that the reason is simple: the Witness Set Constraint is in fact equivalent to Conservativity. There simply cannot be non-conservative determiners that satisfy the Witness Set Constraint. We consider further weakening of the Witness Set Constraint but show that this would allow unattested determiners.</blockquote>
