We are deeply saddened by Aaron Swartz's death, and send our condolences to all who knew him. We are very mindful of his commitment to the open access movement. It inspires our own commitment to work for a situation where academic knowledge is freely available, so that others are not menaced by the kind of prosecution that he faced.  We encourage everyone to visit [www.rememberaaronsw.com](http://www.rememberaaronsw.com), a memorial site created by Aaron's family and friends.
