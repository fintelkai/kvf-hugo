If you have made [a personal profile on Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/citations.html#setup), there is now a new feature when you go to the Google Scholar site: [personalized updates](http://googlescholar.blogspot.com/2012/08/scholar-updates-making-new-connections.html), "My updates", a list of new articles that Google's algorithm determines are related to your own work. When I checked my updates this morning, it looked quite accurate, lots of stuff that I find relevant, quite a bit of which I already knew about but some that I didn't. What would be good is a weekly email summarizing what's new, but in the absence of this it's another page to check out once in a while.
