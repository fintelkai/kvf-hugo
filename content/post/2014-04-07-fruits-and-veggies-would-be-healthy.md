A famous example by Sperber &amp; Wilson shows the context dependency of conversational inferences:

*He*: Will you have some coffee?

*She*: Coffee would keep me awake.

Depending on whether one surmises that she would like to stay awake, one can infer either a positive or negative answer to whether she would like some coffee.

The April 7, 2014 issue of the "Zits" cartoon gives us a new illustration:
