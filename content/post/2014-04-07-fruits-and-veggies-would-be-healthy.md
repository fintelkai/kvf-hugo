A famous example by Sperber &amp; Wilson shows the context dependency of conversational inferences:

*He*: Will you have some coffee?

*She*: Coffee would keep me awake.

Depending on whether one surmises that she would like to stay awake, one can infer either a positive or negative answer to whether she would like some coffee.
