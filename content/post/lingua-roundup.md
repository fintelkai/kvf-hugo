In case you're not glued to social media 24/7, you may have missed some of the coverage of the Lingua → Glossa Affair.

Media coverage after the early [Inside Higher Ed](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/11/02/editors-and-editorial-board-quit-top-linguistics-journal-protest-subscription-fees) article has included:

* a statement of support of the Lingua team by [Peter McPherson, president of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/11/03/public-universities-back-protest-elsevier-pricing)
* [an article at *Ars Technica*](http://arstechnica.co.uk/science/2015/11/entire-editorial-staff-of-elsevier-journal-lingua-resigns-over-high-price-lack-of-open-access/), with some rather uninformed trolling in the comments
* [an article in the *Chronicle of Higher Education*](http://chronicle.com/article/What-a-Mass-Exodus-at-a/234066?cid=trend_right_wc)
* [an article in *Wired*](http://www.wired.com/2015/11/editors-of-the-journal-lingua-protest-quit-in-battle-for-open-access/)

Yesterday, an Elsevier PR blog posted [a mendacious "clarification"](https://www.elsevier.com/connect/addressing-the-resignation-of-the-lingua-editorial-board). In addition to some of the comments on that post, you can look in other places for the truth:

* Martin Eve, the founder of the Open Library of Humanities which will host the new incarnation of *Lingua*, has posted ["Clarifying a few facts for Elsevier and their response to Lingua"](https://www.martineve.com/2015/11/05/clarifying-a-few-facts-for-elsevier-and-their-response-to-lingua/)
* Mike Taylor has posted [a scathing reply to Elsevier](http://svpow.com/2015/11/05/the-editor-had-requested-a-price-of-400-euros-an-apc-that-is-not-sustainable/)

Elsevier claims that it founded *Lingua*, that it therefore has the right to the name, that the proposed open access charge of 400 Euros per article is not sustainable. Obviously, *Lingua* was founded by linguists not by Elsevier. The charge is almost certainly sustainable (in fact, Elsevier has journals that subsist on such a charge). And there are other lies in their statement. (By the way, the PR spokesman is the same person who made [some rather revealing statements about women in STEM](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/curt-rice/the-communications-guy-be_b_4788196.html) last year, as pointed out by Curt Rice, linguist and the president of Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences.)

I stand by [my call for community action](http://kaivonfintel.org/lingua-glossa/): support the Glossa team, do not agree to help Elsevier stand up a sham Zombie Lingua.

To end with a quote from Mike Taylor:

>You know what’s not sustainable? Dragging around the carcass of a legacy barrier-based publisher, with all its expensive paywalls, authentication systems, Shibboleth/Athens/Kerberos integration, lawyers, PR departments, spin-doctors, lobbyists, bribes to politicians, and of course 37.3% profit margins.

>The biggest problem with legacy publishers? They’re just a waste of money.
