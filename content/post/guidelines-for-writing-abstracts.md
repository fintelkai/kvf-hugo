title: Guidelines for writing abstracts

Found via Facebook this morning: [Guidelines for writing abstracts](http://web.mit.edu/fintel/Rooryck&vanHeuven.pdf), drawn up a while ago by Johan Rooryck and Vincent van Heuven after consultation of the Linguist List. I pretty much agree 100% with these guidelines, but about 200% with this one: "Don't put your examples on a separate page, even when the abstract guidelines allow you to do so: abstract reviewers hate having to go back and forth between pages". (This is a corollary of the same principle that banishes endnotes from academic publishing.)
