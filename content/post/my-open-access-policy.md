MIT, of course, has an [Open Access Policy](http://libraries.mit.edu/sites/scholarly/mit-open-access/open-access-at-mit/mit-open-access-policy/), which I am proud to have played a small role in establishing. Having that policy has guided my personal decisions about venues for publishing and reviewing, but I have noticed that I have not always been very principled and consistent in my decisions. So, it is time for my own personal policy. Here it is.

### Kai's Open Access Policy

1. *Journals*: I will only publish in, review for, and serve on editorial boards for journals that allow authors to deposit at least the final manuscript version ("postprint") in an open access repository (such as MIT's Dspace or the Semantics Archive), *without* any embargo (such as having to wait for 24 months before making the OA version available).
2. *Book chapters*: I will personally only contribute book chapters, if the publisher allows me to deposit at least the final manuscript version in an open access repository, *without* any embargo. (I will consider reviewing books or book chapters that are not OA-friendly, because books are a different business from research journals, although I wish that there was more movement towards OA books.)
3. *Books*: I will only publish books myself that have a significant open access component, such as making at least the final manuscript freely available, or even the final published version while charging for print versions of course.


For current reference, here are the policies of leading publishers of relevance to our field(s), culled from the [MIT Libraries list of publisher policies](http://libraries.mit.edu/sites/scholarly/mit-open-access/open-access-at-mit/mit-open-access-policy/publishers-and-the-mit-faculty-open-access-policy/):

* Elsevier: With 2011 revision of author agreement, requires authors to opt out.
* MIT Press: In full cooperation. Allows posting of final published version.
* Springer: MIT and Springer have established an agreement that extends flexible reuse rights to MIT authors of papers published in Springer journals. Among other rights, the final submitted manuscripts of MIT-authored Springer papers can be posted openly in MIT's open access repository DSpace@MIT. Authors should sign the standard Springer agreement and do not need to submit an author's addendum.
* Wiley-Blackwell: Has indicated it will be requiring authors to opt out.

Obviously, this list doesn't include some important publishers, such as Oxford University Press. So, before making any particular decisions, I will consult with whoever is asking me to publish or review for them.
