[Crossposted from [S&P Editors Blog](http://blog.semprag.org)]

We are excited to share good news about the future of *S&P*. We have
been working with the LSA on moving *S&P* out of its current incubating
stage to the next level with fuller support. This morning, the LSA
Executive Committee unanimously approved an agreement to that effect.

As of today, *S&P* is a full-fledged LSA journal, alongside *Language*
but independent of it. The LSA will join MIT and the University of Texas
in providing financial support to the journal. In return, *S&P* is to
become a journal owned by the LSA and titled "Semantics and Pragmatics"
with the subtitle "A Journal of the Linguistic Society of America".

The day-to-day operations of the journal will not change. The current
editorial team will stay in place. The policies and procedures,
including the open access nature of the journal, will remain as they
are. Big decisions will be made cooperatively by the LSA Executive
Committee, the editors, and the *S&P* advisory committee.

Both the LSA and the *S&P* team are excited about this partnership. Open
access is the future of scholarly communication and we intend to work
together to make *S&P* the best journal in its field and a model for our
discipline and others.
