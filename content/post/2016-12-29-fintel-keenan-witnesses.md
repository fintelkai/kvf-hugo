In the fall of 1984, just back from half a year at Cambridge University, I switched universities from Münster to Köln. While in Cambridge, I had decided to study linguistics in addition to English and Philosophy. I did eventually take some intro classes, but what really sucked me in was an advanced seminar offered by Professor Paul Otto Samuelsdorff, who somehow had a manuscript copy of "Boolean semantics for natural language" by Ed Keenan and Leonard Faltz. In the seminar, Samuelsdorff and three of us students embarked on a close study of the book. While I had the mathematical background, everything else was new and exciting. In the same semester, I worked my way through Barwise & Cooper's "Generalized quantifiers and natural language" and I also discovered Larry Horn's thesis "On the semantic properties of logical operators in English". Those three works taken together were simply a revelation and made me decide that this was my calling and that I was going to be a semanticist. [See [my post on Eco](http://kaivonfintel.org/echoes-of-eco/) for further stuff about that time.]

During my time as a graduate student, I met Ed several times at various conferences where I was presenting my work on exceptive phrases. One time he was in Amherst to give talks about the semantics of reflexives and the two of us spent a pleasant afternoon in the Black Sheep calculating and speculating about various technical ideas in generalized quantifier theory that had come up in my work.

Working with one of my scientific idols has been quite an honor (and pleasure).
