[The Art and Craft of Semantics](http://semanticsarchive.net/Archive/jZiNmM4N/) is a Festschrift for Irene Heim that students, colleagues, and friends presented to her yesterday, October 30, 2014, on the occasion of her 60th birthday. I have two co-authored contributions in the collection:

The definiteness paper is a brief report on a rumored account that's been floating around for a while. I hope there'll be follow-up work. The modal comparison paper is a very short plea for Irene's help with some puzzles that are simply too hard for Angelika and me.

Happy birthday, Irene!
