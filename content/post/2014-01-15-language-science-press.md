It's still early days but the open-access revolution in linguistics continues. Stefan MÃ¼ller and Martin Haspelmath, with seed funding from the German Science Foundation (DFG), have started an open access monograph press in linguistics called [*Language Science Press*](http://langsci-press.org). E-books will be free to authors and readers. There will be a print-on-demand option as well. There are several series planned, including one on "Topics at the Grammar-Discourse Interface", edited by Philippa Cook, Anke Holler and Cathrine Fabricius-Hansen. I have enthusiastically agreed to be on the editorial board of this series. You can support the venture in many ways. Sign up at <http://hpsg.fu-berlin.de/OALI/sign/>.
