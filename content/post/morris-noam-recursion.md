I've already shared this picture via the requisite social networks, but here it is for the blog:

<img src="/images/morris-noam-recursion.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-651" />

A picture taken after Noam Chomsky's keynote talk at [Ling50@MIT](http://ling50.mit.edu/), the scientific reunion to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the MIT Linguistics phd program. Morris and Noam are holding a 1988 picture of them holding a 1953 picture of them ... Or, as Bob Frank put it: "The linguists the colleagues the department invited applauded posed for a picture."
