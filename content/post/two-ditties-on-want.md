I've uploaded two short notes on the semantics of desire ascriptions. 

- "On the monotonicity of desire ascriptions" is from a few years ago. It is cited in [a recent paper by Paul Portner and Aynat Rubinstein](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11050-020-09167-7) and I figured I should make it available, since who knows if I ever get around to making a real paper out of it.

- "How weak is your *want*?" contains a few preliminary thoughts on how "weak" the semantics of *want* might be. 

They're on LingBuzz, for what it's worth, but I've also uploaded them at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org), an open access repository run by CERN, where all materials get a permanent DOI link etc.
