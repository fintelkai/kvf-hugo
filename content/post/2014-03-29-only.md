In today's Boston Globe baseball preview section: "Jake Stahl (1912), Ed Barrow (1918), Terry Francona (2004), and John Farrell (2013) are the only Red Sox managers to win the World Series in their first season."

Hmm. Yeah, no. The Red Sox have had [44 managers in their history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Boston_Red_Sox_managers), so when 4 of them win the World Series in their first season, does that really merit an "only"? I mean, what is the expected frequency of a manager winning a world series in their first season? Almost certainly a lot less than 4 in 44.

But the more astonishing fact is that of the 8 World Series wins the Red Sox have had, half of them were by rookie managers. (And one of those, Francona, won another one. So, 5 trophies belong to managers who won one in their first season.) That's definitely not an "only".
