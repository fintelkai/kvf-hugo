Two quick links:

* I was interviewed on the site "How to become a professor" on the topic of ["How to become a professor in linguistics"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6Vg2urvg6g).
* My colleague Caspar Hare appeared on the podcast ["You're the expert"](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/youre-the-expert/id624677543), representing normative ethics. Highly recommended (and thoroughly enjoyable).
