As [announced on the Google Scholar Blog](http://googlescholar.blogspot.com/2011/07/google-scholar-citations.html) yesterday, there is now the option of creating a researcher profile of yourself. Google's documentation of this service ("Google Scholar Citations") is [here](http://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/citations.html).

> Google Scholar Citations is currently in limited launch with a small number of users. This is a new direction for us and we plan to use the experience and feedback from the limited launch to improve the service. Click [here](http://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=new_profile) and follow the instructions to get started. Keep in mind that this is a limited launch and we may not be able to accept new users when you click. If this happens, we'll direct you to a sign-up page where you can register to be notified when Google Scholar Citations is available to all users.

I have worked a bit on [my profile](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C-YA164AAAAJ), correcting some typos (like the spelling of my name ... sigh). NB: "If you have substantially changed the bibliographic record (title, authors, journal, etc.), we may not able to match it up with Google Scholar's index right away. If so, it may take a few days for your citation metrics to include the updated article." That's a bit scary so I haven't gone all out updating the bibliographic details, but I might try it on a test case.
