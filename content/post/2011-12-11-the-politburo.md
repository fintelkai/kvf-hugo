(Taken during Rick Nouwen's colloquium when Irene Heim was introducing the speaker, which is why she's not in the row with us.) (Thanks to Danny Fox for the pointer at the picture and thanks to mitcho for taking the picture!) (Can you put three parentheticals in brackets in a row?) (Sure, you can.)
