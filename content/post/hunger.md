Here's an interesting article [HT: [Steve Crandall](http://tingilinde.typepad.com/starstuff/2013/07/hunger-training.html)]:

Ciampolini, Mario, David Lovell-Smith, Timothy Kenealy, Riccardo Bianchi: 2013. Hunger can be taught: Hunger Recognition regulates eating and improves energy balance. *International Journal of General Medicine*. 6:465-478. DOI: <http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJGM.S40655>.

Why do I find this interesting?

<ul>
<li>Any help with weight control is truly welcome.</li>
<li>I like seeing Open Access journals that are publishing good stuff.</li>
<li>I love that there is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pNP9F0PzRI">a video abstract of the paper</a>.</li>
<li>I like the &quot;Resume&quot; at the end of the paper, which has five short subsections:
<ul>
<li>What was already known</li>
<li>What had been overlooked</li>
<li>What could not be known</li>
<li>What the authorsâ€™ studies have added</li>
<li>Implications</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

Doing this for many scientific articles wouldn't be a bad idea at all.
