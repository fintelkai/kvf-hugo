[Reposted from the [S&P Editors Blog](https://blog.semprag.org/2016/04/28/sp-early-access/)]

Visitors to [S&P's homepage](http://semprag.org) will see our newest feature in action. Accepted papers for which we have a LaTeX source file will, with the authors' permission, now immediately be published in an "early access" version. They will already be assigned their final DOI, so they can be linked and referred to as officially published. This way they can be listed on CVs with all their final citation details (with the sole exception of missing page numbers, since we won't know how many pages the article has until the final typeset version).

This year's volume of S&P already shapes up to be epic. We invite you to browse through the amazing collection of articles that our authors have entrusted to S&P.
