title: Get cloaked!

I like to take my devices to coffeeshops and get some work done. I also travel once in a while. At all those times I connect via wireless connections that are far from secure. So, a few months ago I discovered [*Cloak*](https://www.getcloak.com), a great VPN service that painlessly and automatically secures my net traffic every time I connect to a wireless network that I haven't explicitly marked as trusted. I have a $2.99/month "mini" subscription that gives me 5GB of data throughput. My laptop, my iPhone, and my iPad are all set up to use the service. Highly recommended!
